Read the readme.txt files which explain what each folder does

Many files which are too large are stored in the MEGA cloud service. These missing files are documented in a missing_data_files.txt in each folder. If there is none, then all the files are presenet in THAT FOLDER ALONE. You would need to sign up for an account to gain access to it. The link is https://mega.nz/#fm/HAxWSSjR!49331DES7YUIW5866ZAinw
