combining_regions_and_genes.ipynb - code for analysis of genes in the NVR and VR
exports/results/ - results that was generated from the exports from IPA. The names of each file is self explanitory. N.B vr_interations_count_incomplete.txt is incomplete since we ran out of exports from IPA per month
exports/splits/nvr/ - exports from IPA for the NVR
exports/splits/vr/ - exports from IPA for the VR
exports/symbols/ - combined the results from exports/splits/nvr/ and exports/splits/vr/ and combined them for analysis
remove_duplicate_gene_start_stop.ipynb - remove all the duplicates from the genes data as there can be different gene ids assigned to the exact same start and stop coordinates
missing_data_files.txt -> Once this file is in a folder it means that the file is large and I put it in the Mega link. The names of the files are stored here.
