This directory is the main one with the folders to subprojects.
Compare DECIHPER and VR .ipynb - Code showing how decipher when included, the analysis that is done
decipher files -> files containing decipher data
DocumentationforBioinformatics.docx - high level and some details that are not explicitly stated in the code
gc_content -> manually found cog islands but it is not used since we downloaded it from UCSC
gene_analysis -> all the work done for the genes
generate_nvr_and_vr.ipynb -> code showing how I got the NVR and VRs
missing_data_files.txt -> Once this file is in a folder it means that the file is large and I put it in the Mega link. The names of the files are stored here.
overlap -> a somewhat generic python example of combining two files.
regulators -> analysis done with many regulators downloaded from UCSC
